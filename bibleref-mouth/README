The bibleref-mouth package

The bibleref-mouth package is a LaTeX2e library that allows Bible references to
be formatted in a consistent way. It is similar to the bibleref package, except
that the formatting macros are all purely expandable. That is, they are all
implemented in TEX's mouth. This means that they can be used in any expandable
context, such as an argument to the \url command. To write a reference, the
document should use the command \bibleref{reference}.

This package depends on the following packages.
 * etoolbox
 * fmtcount
 * hyperref

To extract the code, run:
 * tex bibleref-mouth.ins
Then put bibleref-mouth.sty into a directory searched by TeX.

To extract the documentation, run:
 * pdflatex bibleref-mouth.dtx
