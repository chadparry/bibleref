The bibleref-lds package

The bibleref-lds package is an extension of the bibleref-mouth package that
supports references for the scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (LDS). To write a reference, the document should use the
command \bibleref{reference}, exactly as with the stock bibleref-mouth package.

This package depends on the following packages.
 * bibleref-mouth
 * ifthen
 * hyperref

To extract the code, run:
 * tex bibleref-lds.ins
Then put bibleref-lds.sty into a directory searched by TeX.

To extract the documentation, run:
 * pdflatex bibleref-lds.dtx
